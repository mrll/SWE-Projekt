# Software Engineering Project - Lasercutter Simulator

![](Assets/LaserCutter.png)

This is a project from a software-engineering class.

It's a parser for a pseudo lasercutter opcode, including the simulation of the lasercutter. It's using the MVC pattern. The parsercode is completely independent from the UI and is only using STL C++ stuff. We used QT4 as the UI framework (UI is in German).
